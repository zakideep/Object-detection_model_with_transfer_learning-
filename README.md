# Object-detection_model
ðŸš€ Project Overview:
This project applies transfer learning to object detection using a pre-trained deep learning model. It identifies and localizes objects in images by drawing bounding boxes around detected objects.
ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used:
   â€¢	The model is trained on the KITTI dataset, which is widely used in autonomous driving research.
   â€¢	Dataset Breakdown:
      o	Training Set: 6,347 images
      o	Validation Set: 423 images
      o	Test Set: 711 images
ðŸŽ¯ Model Details:
   â€¢	Pre-trained Model Used: ResNet50
   â€¢	Framework: TensorFlow
   â€¢	Transfer Learning: Fine-tuned ResNet50 on the KITTI dataset for object detection.
   â€¢	Training Time: ~26 minutes (1586 seconds)
